I had help to solve this problem :)

There is an ASCII file named _www.com_ but it can be an executable file which can run on **MS-DOS**.
So we can install dosbox on linux. The point is we have to use debugger on our dosbox to get our flag. -> `Enhanced DEBUG (formally DOS Debug)`

`sudo apt install dosbox`
