This challenge was simply a cryptography (caesar cipher).

I had a few ideas to solve this challenge. Like using _OCR_ to get text and analyze it, but it wasn't quite good. So I looked at text and saw this text `VMY{vtxltkvbiaxkbltlnulmbmnmbhgvbiaxk}` and figured it is like `CTF{}` so I decided to use caesar cipher only on this characters and got the flag.
