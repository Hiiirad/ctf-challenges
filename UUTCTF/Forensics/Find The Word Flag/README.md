**This task took some time from me and I really enjoyed solving it :)**

Steps to solve this challenge:

  1. `$ unzip Word.docx`
  2. Under the folder word we see a file named _document.xml_, had xml code with a lot of spaces.
  3. I used my python script (get-flag.py) to convert spaces to hexadecimals.
  4. Then I used an online [site](https://codebeautify.org/hex-string-converter) to convert hex to readable format.
  5. Done
